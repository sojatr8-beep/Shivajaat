<h2><big>Paragraph about Optimus Prime</big></h2>
<hr />

<p><b><i><big>Optimus Prime is the brave and powerful leader of the Autobots in the Transformers universe. He is known for his strong sense of justice, courage, and loyalty toward protecting humanity. Despite being a giant robot, Optimus Prime always values peace and tries to avoid fights unless it is truly necessary. His iconic red-and-blue truck form and his deep, powerful voice make him one of the most memorable heroes of all time. Whether it’s facing Megatron or saving Earth from danger, Optimus Prime always stands as a symbol of hope, strength, and leadership.</big></i></b></p>
